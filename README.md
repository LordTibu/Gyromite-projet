## Game description

You control Prof. Hector as he moves around collecting bombs
in his laboratory, seen from the side in 2D. The laboratory is made up of a
of levels. The scientist can move left, right,
and climb up or down using ropes. A level may contain
pillars (blue and red) that can be raised or lowered when the
player presses a specific key. Finally, the teacher must avoid
the enemies, the Smicks. The aim is to collect all the bombs
bombs, avoiding enemies while manipulating the pillars to create
paths if necessary.
